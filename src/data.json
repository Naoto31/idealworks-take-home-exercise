Also, go to Settings > Battery to see which apps are consuming the most power. Sometimes, a rogue app could be causing the drain. Try that and let us know if it helps!",

Poor cellular or Wi-Fi signal can lead to increased battery usage as your phone tries to maintain a connection. You might want to toggle on Airplane mode in areas with weak signals to see if that makes a difference.",
